# Shortcuts
[![Build](https://github.com/SimonNyvall/Shortcuts/blob/main/.github/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)]

A shortcut application in the console. the idea is that this application should work like the shortcut app on ios.
Will add some basic commands that is going to be executed on a timer specified by the user.

In later version I want to add custom commands.
